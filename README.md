# Coffee-Sales-Insights

Project Purpose

The Coffee Sales Dashboard in Excel is crafted to offer a comprehensive view of our coffee business. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and loyalty programs. This dashboard helps in understanding key metrics that drive our business and supports data-driven decision-making.

About the Data
For this project, the data was stored in a CSV file, organized into three sections:

Orders
Customer
Quantity

These sheets contained information about our coffee sales, our customers, and the quantities of coffee they ordered. To streamline the analysis, I used a lookup function to combine the relevant details from these different sheets into one cohesive dataset, referred to as the "Customer" column. This consolidated data provides valuable insights into our customers' coffee orders, purchase quantities, and other critical details.

In simple terms, I transformed fragmented data from multiple sources into a neat and organized format, making it easier to understand and analyze our coffee sales.

Approach Used

Data Manipulation and Visualization
The approach involved both data manipulation and visualization. The dashboard includes several key features:

Total Sales Over Time: 
This visualization helps track revenue growth and identify seasonal patterns in sales.
Sales by Customer: This section highlights our top-performing clients, allowing us to target our efforts effectively.

Interactive Features

To enhance user interactivity and insights, I incorporated three slicers. These slicers enable users to filter data by:

Coffee Size

Coffee Type

Presence of a Quantity Card among customers

This dynamic functionality provides a deeper understanding of our coffee offerings and the impact of loyalty programs on sales.


Conclusion

This Coffee Sales Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of our coffee business, enabling us to make data-driven decisions. By understanding sales trends, customer preferences, and the impact of loyalty programs, we can optimize our strategies to drive growth and improve customer satisfaction.
